# youtube-downloader-converter
A simple Python3 script that is able to download YouTube videos or playlists and convert them into MP3.

Pytube is a requirement, so use `pip3 install pytube` to install it if you don't have it already.

New features of this fork:
 1. YouTube to Playlist to MP3 Conversion
 2. No longer keeps an MP4 and an MP3 if you want an MP3. Now, it will download the MP4 and then delete it after converting (the conversion was required in the old code). 
 3. Creating a folder when downloading multiple files for organization.
